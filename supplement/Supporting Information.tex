\noindent\textbf{Introduction}


This supporting information includes:

\begin{itemize}

\item[1)]  Figure S1: Figure depicting the warming patterns averaged from Oct. to March. based on the CMIP5 ensemble mean compared to the recent historical for the natural, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5.

%the averaged precipitation and April 1st SWE from WRF at 27 km, and 

\item[2)]  Figure S2: Figure depicting the station locations for the observed precipitation and April 1st SWE (note: for the SWE, the black dots refer to the stations with data of the season 2015-2016 and green stars refer to the ones of the season 2016-2017).

\item[3)]  Figure S3: Figure depicting the model evaluation of the simulated Pr and SWE according to the station observations and the corresponding simulated values over the Sierra Nevada, and the relevant spatial pattern of the model output. For the drier year of 2015-2016, the relative bias between the model and observations averaged over all the stations is around 21$\%$, with a mean observed Pr of 5.7 mm$/$day. For the extremely wet year of 2016-2017, the average bias is around 2.4 mm/day, compared to the mean observed Pr of 11.6 mm$/$day. For April 1st SWE, the model underestimates SWE somewhat in 2016 with an average underestimation of 155.7 mm, compared to the mean observed SWE of 645.8 mm. For year 2017, the average bias is around 231.7 mm compared to the mean observed SWE of 1248.4 mm, or about 24$\%$.

\item[4)]  Figure S4: Figure depicting the near-surface temperature from WRF at 9km for the seasons 2015-2016 and 2016-2017.
